## About Uppalavannarama

Uppalavannarama Bhikkhunupassaya Kappiya Association was founded in 2023 out of the intention of individuals in the Sydney Buddhist lay community to support an urban bhikkhuni residence for the practice and study of early Buddhism. The association operates under the guidance of Ayya Suvira. The association assists bhikkhunis, sikkhamanas and samaneris by providing a rented residence in Harris Park (Uppalavannarama or UBU), and material support to invited monastics.


## About Ayya Suvira

Ayya Suvira received novice ordination in 2016, and full ordination as a bhikkhuni in 2019 with Ayya Santini Mahatheri of Indonesia as preceptor. Ayya Suvira is secretary of the Australian Sangha Association, a national peak body representing Buddhist monks and nuns in Australia. She also represents the Australian Sangha Association on the advisory groups of Cemeteries and Crematoria NSW, Catholic Cemeteries and Crematoria, and Metropolitan Memorial Parks.


## Practice

The primary source of teaching and practice at Uppalavannarama is the text of the Pali suttas and vinaya, which record the words of the Buddha, which we live in the local context. As a “hermit-at-heart,” Ayya Suvira’s dream is to eventually be able to use the bhikkhuni residence to support a higher level of meditation practice in seclusion, with few external commitments, as per the model of the Buddha’s disciples, Venerables Anuruddha, Nandiya and Kimbila in the Upakkilesa Sutta in MN128.

Ayya Suvira encourages all people to sincerely practice meritorious deeds and the ten wholesome dhammas; and to learn, practice and transmit Buddhism widely for the purpose of liberation.

## Visiting & (No) Meal Policy

There is no visitation without a prior appointment. Please contact us to make an appointment.

Please note that Ayya Suvira and visiting sangha have not accepted dana bookings, i.e. with the sole purpose of meal donation, or meal invitations since 2021. There is no fixed alms-route time or location (alms-route may vary without notice).

## Message from the Treasurer

If you would like to assist with financial support for the material wellbeing, dhamma activities, travel and communications needs of the resident bhikkhuni sangha we invite you to make a donation to the account of the lay association monastic stewards “kappiyas” that issue open invitation to material support for the resident bhikkhuni sangha.

On behalf of the lay stewards: a big “anumodana” - we rejoice in the beauty of your kind support to the bhikkhuni sangha!
