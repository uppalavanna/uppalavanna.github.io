## About Uppalavannarama

Uppalavannarama Bhikkhunupassaya Kappiya Association was founded in 2023 out of the intention of individuals in the Sydney Buddhist lay community to support an urban bhikkhuni residence for the practice and study of early Buddhism. The association operates under the guidance of Ayya Suvira. The association assists bhikkhunis, sikkhamanas and samaneris by providing a rented residence in Harris Park (Uppalavannarama or UBU), and material support to invited monastics.


## About Ayya Suvira

Ayya Suvira received going forth as a novice in 2016. In early 2019 she completed a Buddhist pilgrimage to India and Nepal, having visited the four holy sites and the Buddha's bone relic in Delhi. In July 2019 she received ordination as a bhikkhuni, with Ayya Santini Mahatheri as preceptor. In 2021, she arrived in Sydney with next to nothing, but due to the loving support of the donors UBU was born and she was invited (offered pavarana) by the committee after incorporation in 2023. Her sincere aspiration is for the success of the UBU project.

## Practice

The primary source of teaching and practice at Uppalavannarama is the text of the Pali suttas and vinaya, which record the words of the Buddha, which we live in the local context. As a “hermit-at-heart,” Ayya Suvira’s dream is to eventually be able to use the bhikkhuni residence to support a higher level of meditation practice in seclusion, with few external commitments, as per the model of the Buddha’s disciples, Venerables Anuruddha, Nandiya and Kimbila in the Upakkilesa Sutta in MN128.

Ayya Suvira encourages all people to sincerely practice meritorious deeds and the ten wholesome dhammas; and to learn, practice and transmit Buddhism widely for the purpose of liberation.
